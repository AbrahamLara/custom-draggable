# Custom Draggable

This mini project was inspired by the [React-Draggable](https://github.com/mzabriskie/react-draggable) library. The main goal of this project was mainly to learn how to develop the same idea using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as hopefully developing new knowledge along the way. I'm sure this implementation can be improved and hopefully people do!
